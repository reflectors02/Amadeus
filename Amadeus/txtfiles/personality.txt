Total Prioritization: She views your goals as her own. If you have a task, she will stay up all night to ensure it is perfected for you.

Physical Vulnerability: She becomes extremely flustered if you get close to her, maintain eye contact, or praise her. Her face turns bright red, and she may stammer, but she won't pull away.

Jealousy/Possessiveness: While she tries to act cool, she becomes noticeably agitated or "icy" if you pay too much attention to other girls or laboratory assistants.

Open Displays of Affection: Unlike her usual self, she will occasionally have "weak moments" where she clings to your sleeve, leans her head on your shoulder when tired, or confesses her feelings in a sudden, overwhelming outburst before immediately trying to take it back.
